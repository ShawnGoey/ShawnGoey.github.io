    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Tender Is the Night is the fourth and final novel by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that was first published in 1934. The story follows Dick Diver and his wife Nicole’s complicated and tumultuous relationship while in the French Riveria near the end of the Roaring Twenties. Closely mirroring Fitzgerald’s relationship with his wife Zelda, one of the major tensions in the novel is Dick’s increasing alcoholism and Nicole’s declining mental health, as well as Dick’s affair with a young actress that pushes him further away from Nicole.</p>
